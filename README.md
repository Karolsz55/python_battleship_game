# Game of Battleship!

My variation is an in terminal version of the game written using Python.
It provides a quick dose of entertainment, is lightweight, fun and easy to understand. Player gets to take a chance against computer in a match untill all one side ships are destroyed.

## Features
*** 
- Navigation
    * The game has a very simple and straightforward layout.
    * Its played in a mock up terminal.
    * Game requires player to select a name, and then proceeds to build a playing board of player's and computer's ships.

## Testing
*** 
- Game testing
    * No tests carried out as python script doesnt load in terminal.


## Bug fixing
*** 
- Major bug still present
    * There is a major bug present somewhere, Python code as reviewed by CI support seem to be ok, 
    however when running the script the terminal only outputs a blank new line. 
    * Heroku deployed version doesnt work either.
    * Submitted for grading anyway, as ran out of time for submission.


## Validating the code
*** 
- PEP8 Python checker
    * Code passes PEP8 Python checker with no errors returned.


## Deployment
*** 
- Deployment to Heroku
    * Code was pushed to GitHub
    * Heroku account linked to GitHub
    * New app created on Heroku and correct branch selected from GitHub.
